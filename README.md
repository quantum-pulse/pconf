this is a vim plugin that allows to compile small projects.

## Dependencies
* valgrind
* gdb
* the following vim plugins:
	* that's a bad joke. you can configure your vim the way you want to of course.
	* find included my vimrc (as an example) to check my key bindings nothing new to vim users	 

## Reconizes
* c
* c++
* python
* rust
```
todo ->	add java, perl, go 
```
## Detects
*  makefile project
*  cmake project:
```
todo -> needs to be improved, didn't run enough test
todo -> add detection of Cargo.toml
```
## Allows
* execution of elf binary  
* debugging of elf binary
* quick leak memory checking

this python plugin still needs a lot of work and improvement but with time and only time it will get better!!
this plugin is not exceptionnal but it is really convenient as far as I'm concerned. 
I call it a real draft.

2) move the contained vimrc to $HOME/.vimrc 
	or
